A __Secure Shell__, or __Secure Socket Shell__, is a network protocol that allows devices to achieve two important things: communicate and share data. Additionally, the SSH protocol also encrypts data, making it ideal for unsecured networks.

## Learning Objectives

- What is a __server__
- Where servers usually live
- What is `SSH`
- How to create an `SSH RSA` key pair
- How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair
- The advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `/bin/bash`

## Projects thought process
=======
# SSH

In this project, I became familiar connecting to and working
with servers using the SSH protocol. I worked on a server
provided by ALX.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Use a private key**
  * [0-use_a_private_key](./0-use_a_private_key): Bash script that uses `ssh` to connect to my
Holberton-provided server.

* **1. Create an SSH key pair**
  * [1-create_ssh_key_pair](./1-create_ssh_key_pair): Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.

* **2. Client configuration file**
  * [2-ssh_config](./2-ssh_config): SSH configuration file configured to use the private key
`~/.ssh/holberton` and to refuse authentication using a password.
